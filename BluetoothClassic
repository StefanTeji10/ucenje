Bluetooth je: low power, short range, low datarate
Bluetooth se odrzava od strane Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group)
Bluetooth SIG je grupa od 30+ kompanija... Oni odrzavaju i Bluetooth Classic i Bluetooth BLE

Bluetooth spec
2.4 - 2.4835 GHz (ISM band) Industrial Sientific and Medical
2 MHz guard band at a low end, and 3.5 MHz on the Top end
79 channels, spaced at 1 MHz, and they starts at 2.4 GHz

Modulation Schemes used:
GFSK - Gaussian Frequency Shift Key (1 Mb/s)
Pi/4 DQPSK - Differential Quadrature Phasial Shift Keying (2 Mb/s)
8 DPSK - Differential Phasial Shift Keying (3 Mb/s)

HS - High Speed --> WiFi, 25 Mb/s

General Topology - Bluetooth
Master/Slave
* Up to 7 slaves in a Piconet
* "Park" slaves

Bluetooth uses FHSS - Frequency Hoping Spread Spectrum
  * FHSS hops around frequencies 1600 hops/s (hops per second)
  * Pseudorandom sequence, seeded by Master MAC address
  * Timing is determined by master's CLK
  
  Bluetooth classic uses TDM (Time domain multiplexing)
  Master sets time stamps, each one is 625 uS
  
 There are two different kinds of connection that we are looking here:
 * SCO - Synchronous Connection Oriented
 * ACL - Asynchronous Connection-Less
 
 Generic form of a data format 
  72 bits      ---      54      ---       0-2744

 Access Code

  preamble  --- Synchronization --- Trailer
  Note: Synchronization is derived from Master's ID

 AM_ABDR  --- type  --- Flow  --- ARQN  --- SEQN --- HEC
 Note:
 AM_ABDR - active member address
 Type - 12 packet types, 4 control types 
 HEC - Header Error Check
 
 Conection Sequence
 State Machine that bluetooth is doing durring the connection sequence
 There are basically two states that it can exists in. Two primary states.
 1. Stand-by state
 2. Connected
 And in between those two you have a number of other things:
 * page and master response
 * page scan and slave response
 * INQ (Inquery)
 * INQ Scan and INQ response
 Those are various roads between Stand-by state and Connected state
 
Describtion of connection sequence:
1. Slave need to be put into the discoverable mode
* being discoverable means that if it gets an inquery from Master device, the device that wants to connect, he will respond
* What slave is listening to: The slave device will listen to 32 INQ channels
* Master will separate those 32 frequences into 16 frequency trains, and Master will cycle through those 2 frequency trains and it will sent out ID packets with GIAC 
(General Inquary Access Code)
2. When the slave hears the Master device, it will back off (stop doing anything for a little bit) and then it will send an Inquary response that includes:
- FHS (Frequency hopping sequence)
- it's own ID
- It's own clock
3. And when Master picks this message (Inquary response) it goes to PAGE mode, and the slave is going to Page Scan mode
* When Master is in the PAGE mode, it will address this slave device on a new hopping sequence (which is derived from FHS (previous message from slave to master))
* Master is sending page
4. Slave response with DAC (Device Access code)
5. Master response with FHS (it's frequency hopping sequence) --> now we are going to third hopping sequence which is based on the Masters ID, and Masters clock
6. Slave gives one more response with locale device access code, after which it is switching to the masters hopping sequence...
CONNECTED!!!

Slave in connected State: There are 4 modes of function
1. Active mode, where everything is happening
2. "sniff mode", it is listening to reduces number of time slots
3. Hold mode, No ACL, and it will do SCO, reduced power
4. Parked mode sit down and shut up


Profiles:
* Profile defines attributes, services and formats... basically defines how you talk to the bluetooth radio at a high level nad what kind of 
  services and perforamnce you shoud expect
* doezens of profiles (Developer needs to choose) --> 
  * SPP (Serial port protocol)  --> put data in and get data out :-) two way link
  
  
Bluetooth stack
From the top:
HOST STACK  ---> this is happening outside of a bluetooth chip, high devices
1. Application leyer
2. Huge number of protocols: 
Example:  a) TCS - telephonie controlled protocol specification
          b) OBEX - Object Exchange                        ----> these are followed by RF COMM (RF comm is a serial link)
          3) WAP - Wireless Application protocol          -----> these are followed by RF COMM
          4) SDP - Service discovery protocol
3. Logical Link Central + Adaption Protocol (L2Cap) ---> it takes data from each protocols [i podesava te podatke tako da HCI Host Controller moze da ih procita] 
END OF HOST STACK
CONTROLLER STACK ---> on a bluetooth chip
4. HCI - Host Controller Interface  ---> At commands ...
5. Linked menager protocol
6. Baseband Link Controller
7. Radio
END OF CONTROLLER STACK
